      <br/> ANSWER 2: What I wanted to learn or do more of at work is to get to know my colleagues better. I wanted to build relationship
     to as many as I could because I know that it will help me with my work.
     <br/> ANSWER 3: I was running a change which was handed over from a different region. The case is a very long pending case..
    Because I was new, I wasn't familiar with some hiccups that may happen.
      So, as I was running the script from the UI, the page just froze up and went on a blank screen. I wasn't sure if the script
      ran successfully and I couldn't re-run it as it would mess up the system. Then I thought of checking the localhost logs. From there,
      I was able to see that the script was still running and I just need to monitor it from the logs instead.
      <br/> ANSWER 4:Based on what I understand,  choose Edge Functions for lightweight tasks that need to run close to the user, Serverless Functions for more complex backend logic, and Edge Middleware for enhancing performance and security.
      <br/> ANSWER 5:Ask specific questions like where exactly are they encountering the issue, their environment details and steps to reproduce. It will be easier to investigate if you get as many details as you can and if you can reproduce the issue in house.

      <br/> ANSWER 7:Hi, if you're utilizing a web server such as Apache or Nginx, you can accomplish redirects by integrating a redirect directive into the configuration file. For instance, within Apache's .htaccess file, you can implement the following rule: ewriteEngine On RewriteRule ^blog(.*)$ https://example.com$1 [R=301,L]. This directive will automatically redirect any requests to '/blog' and its subdirectories to 'https://example.com'.
      <br/> ANSWER 8:Hi, To prevent search engines from indexing your website, you can follow these steps:
Robots.txt File: Generate a robots.txt file and store it in your website's main directory. Within this file, you can outline which sections of your site should be excluded from search engine indexing. For instance, to block all search engine crawlers from indexing your entire site, you can incorporate the following instruction:
User-agent: * Disallow: /
      <br/> ANSWER 9:Not sure since I havenâ€™t used Vercel yet until now.
      <br/> ANSWER 10:This is my first time performing this exercise but it would help if the time limit is longer since some applicants are not yet familiar with the Vercel application.
